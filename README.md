# WEEK-1
TO DEVELOP A CNN MODEL TO CLASSIFY IMAGES OF PLASTIC WASTE

## Project Objective
The primary aim of developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of plastic waste is to facilitate efficient and automated waste segregation for environmental sustainability. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model can accurately identify and categorize different types of plastic waste, such as bottles, bags, and packaging materials, based on their visual characteristics. This classification can enhance recycling processes, reduce human intervention, and support waste management systems in minimizing plastic pollution. Ultimately, the project seeks to contribute to global efforts in promoting a circular economy and protecting ecosystems from the harmful impact of plastic waste.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is Waste Classification Data. It contains a total of 25,077 labeled images, divided into two categories: Organic and Recyclable.
Dataset is divided into train data (85%) and test data (15%)  
Training data - 22564 images and Test data - 2513 images
